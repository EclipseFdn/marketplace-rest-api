# Marketplace API Snapshot data

## What this is

An anonymized sample of data pulled from production to accelerate development of fixes and integrations. This should be updated any time there is a shift in the base data structure, with a date stamp to reflect when the data was pulled. These files can be used out of the box with the Restore from backup instructions to simplify starting a local instance of this API. Any time this data is updated, it should be done using the gzip compression flag to reduce the amount of data that needs to transfer over the wire.

## What this isn't

- A viable backup of production data  
- A place to find data with personal information (i.e. user names, IDs)
